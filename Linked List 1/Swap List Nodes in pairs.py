"""Swap List Nodes in pairs


Problem Description

Given a linked list A, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

NOTE: Your algorithm should use only constant space. You may not modify the values in the list, only nodes itself can be changed.



Problem Constraints

1 <= |A| <= 106


Input Format

The first and the only argument of input contains a pointer to the head of the given linked list.


Output Format

Return a pointer to the head of the modified linked list.


Example Input

Input 1:

 A = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4

Input 2:

 A = 7 -> 2 -> 1



Example Output

Output 1:

 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3

Output 2:

 2 -> 7 -> 1



Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 In the first example (1, 2) and (3, 4) are the adjacent nodes. Swapping them will result in 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3

Explanation 2:

 In the second example, 3rd element i.e. 1 does not have an adjacent node, so it won't be swapped. """
"""
Hint 1

A->B->C.

Take a look at A,B. How can you change the next pointer of these elements without changing their values such that they are swapped?

"""
Solution Approach

Lets first look at the problem of swapping 2 nodes.

Method 1: Just swap the values in the 2 nodes. In most cases, this wonâ€™t be a permissible solution.
Method 2: Move around the pointers.

"""
Hint 1
Note how the number XVI(10+5+1) and XIV(10-1+5) differs.

In one case we are adding the numeric value of a letter and in other case we are subtracting it. How can you simulate this?
"""
"""
Solution Approach

The key is to notice that in a valid Roman numeral representation the letter with the most value always occurs at the start of the string.

Whenever a letter with lesser value precedes a letter of higher value, it means its value has to be added as negative of that letterâ€™s value.

In all other cases, the values get added.

Coin Change

Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we have infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins, how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.

For example, 
for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, 
there are four solutions: {1,1,1,1}, {1,1,2}, {2,2} and {1,3}. 
So output should be 4. 

For N = 10 and S = {2, 5, 3, 6}, 
there are five solutions: {2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} and {5,5}. 
So the output should be 5.

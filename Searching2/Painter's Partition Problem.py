"""
Painter's Partition Problem

Problem Description

Given 2 integers A and B and an array of integers C of size N. Element C[i] represents length of ith board.
You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 â€¦ CN-1]. There are A painters available and each of them takes B units of time to paint 1 unit of board.

Calculate and return minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of board.

NOTE:
1. 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
2. A painter will only paint contiguous boards. Which means a configuration where painter 1 paints board 1 and 3 but not 2 is invalid.

Return the ans % 10000003.



Problem Constraints

1 <= A <= 1000
1 <= B <= 106
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= C[i] <= 106


Input Format

The first argument given is the integer A.
The second argument given is the integer B.
The third argument given is the integer array C.


Output Format

Return minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of board % 10000003.


Example Input

Input 1:

 A = 2
 B = 5
 C = [1, 10]

Input 2:

 A = 10
 B = 1
 C = [1, 8, 11, 3]



Example Output

Output 1:

 50

Output 2:

 11



Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 Possibility 1:- One painter paints both blocks, time taken = 55 units.
 Possibility 2:- Painter 1 paints block 1, painter 2 paints block 2, time take = max(5, 50) = 50
 There are no other distinct ways to paint boards.
 ans = 50%10000003

Explanation 2:

 Each block is painted by a painter so, Painter 1 paints block 1, painter 2 paints block 2, painter 3 paints block 3 
 and painter 4 paints block 4, time taken = max(1, 8, 11, 3) = 11
 ans = 11%10000003

 Hint 1

Hint : Think binary search for the answer.

If you had a function bool isPossible which could tell you if its possible to paint the boards in time T or less, can you solve the problem ?
"""
"""
Solution Approach

If you have already solved the problem corresponding to hint1, you are already halfway there.

You can do a binary search for the answer :

  start = 0, end = max_time_possible
  mid = (start + end) / 2
  if isPossible(mid): 
  	end = mid - 1
  else 
	start = mid + 1

Now, lets look into how isPossible would be implemented.
Keep assigning boards to painter greedily till the time taken < mid. If you run out of painters, isPossible = false.
else isPossible = true.

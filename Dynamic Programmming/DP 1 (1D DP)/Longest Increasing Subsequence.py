"""
Longest Increasing Subsequence


Problem Description

Find the longest increasing subsequence of a given array of integers, A.

In other words, find a subsequence of array in which the subsequence's elements are in strictly increasing order, and in which the subsequence is as long as possible.

In this case, return the length of the longest increasing subsequence.



Problem Constraints

1 <= length(A) <= 2500
0 <= A[i] <= 2500



Input Format

The first and the only argument is an integer array A.



Output Format

Return an integer representing the length of the longest increasing subsequence.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = [1, 2, 1, 5]

Input 2:

 A = [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15]



Example Output

Output 1:

 3

Output 2:

 6



Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 The longest increasing subsequence: [1, 2, 5]

Explanation 2:

 The possible longest increasing subsequences: [0, 2, 6, 9, 13, 15] or [0, 4, 6, 9, 11, 15] or [0, 4, 6, 9, 13, 15]

Hint 1

Try to compute longest increasing subsequence ending at ith position for all i.

Think how can you use answers ending on 1st, 2nd, 3rd, â€¦.(i-1)th positions for computing answers ending on ith position.

Hint: Expected Complexity - O(N2)

Solution Approach

Let dp[i] denotes the length of longest increasing subsequence ending at index i with first i elements.

How can we calculate dp[i], if we know dp[j] for all j < i ?

Just run a loop for 0<=j<=i-1, if A[j] < A[i] Update dp[i] = max(dp[i], 1 + dp[j]).

Fill all the dp states. Time complexity will be O(N2) as we are running two loops one for i and one for j.

Final answer = max(dp[i] for all i from 1 to N).

Bonus: Try to solve in NlogN time complexity.
